comment: A fruit may contain additional plant structures (PO:0009011) that were part of a flower (PO:0009046) and mature along with the gynoecium, such as a receptacle (PO:0009064). A fruit may develop without fertilization in cases of parthenocarpy, apomixis, or other hormone-induced conditions and may not always contain seeds. Fruits only occur in angiosperms.

comment: In some cases, a gynoecium (PO:0009062) may consist of only one carpel, in which case annotations should go on carpel (PO:0009030). The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium, but if a gynoecium consists of a single carpel, then pistil may be used synonymously with carpel. If carpels are fused, the gynoecium is a syncarpous gynoecium, as in Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae. If carpels are free, the gynoecium is an apocarpous gynoecium, as in Fabaceae. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

def: "A shoot axis that extends from the last foliage leaf on a stem or branch until the next distal node." [ISBN:9781842464229, POC:curators]
comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary inflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch. The peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

comment: If annotating gene expression to a gynoecium with a single carpel (PO:0009030), the annotation should go on carpel. A gynoecium with two or more carpels may be either syncarpous (carpels fused) or apopcarpous (carpels free) or the carpels may be partially fused. The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium for a synocarpous gynoecium, and synonymously with carpel for an apocarpous gynoecium, whether it has one or more carpels. In Zea mays, gynoecia of tassel florets and of the lower florets of ear spikelets usually do not develop fully, and they are present in a rudimentary state. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type.

In grasses, the hypocotyl and cotyledon may not be visible and may be represented by the scutellar node and scutellum, making the mesocotyl similar to the epicotyl in other taxa. Elongation of the mesocotyl during seedling growth pushes the coleoptile above the soil surface.

comment: This is a parent term to describe both collective organ part structure (PO:0025269)  (e.g. septum), as well as collective plant organ structure (PO:0025007) (which was formerly named collective plant structure), for example shoot system (PO:0009006).

comment: Includes cardinal parts of plant organs (PO:0025001) as well as parts of other multi-tissue plant structures. Cardinal refers to the fact that these are biologically meaningful and not arbitrary parts. Most cardinal parts of multi-tissue plant structures have both fiat and bona-fide boundaries, including parts with large fiat boundaries, such as leaf base (PO:0020040) or fruit distal end (PO:0008001), and parts with primarily bona-fide boundaries, such as leaflet (PO:0020049).

comment: Functions in storage of photosynthate metabolites. May develop from a branch (PO:0025073) or a root (PO:0009005).  If you are annotating to tuber, you should pick the more specific child term: shoot axis tuber (PO:0004543) or tuberous root tuber (PO:0025476).

comment: The shoot system (PO:0009006) develops fron the shoot apical meristem (PO:0020148) in the plant embryo (PO:0009009) in vascular plants.  In lower plants the gametophore (PO:0030018) arises from a gametophore meristematic apical cell (PO:0030019) in the protonema (PO:0030003).

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.
